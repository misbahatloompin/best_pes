# Follow-up actions (Action backlog)

## Purpose
Generate a structured action backlog designed to lift **Owned BES (raw)** by ~25%.

## Inputs used
- Prime Owned aggregates from brand-period data
- Prime top posts (Owned + Earned) from posts data
- Competitor reference posts (Owned) for tone/format inspiration

## Competitor used for inspiration
- Prefers “BRAC Bank PLC” if present
- Otherwise picks the competitor with the highest total EP

## Output structure
Each initiative includes:
- stable key (e.g., PB-EPIC-01)
- objective and why it matters
- focus tags
- suggested owner role
- effort points
- work items with deliverables, completion checks, and rollout weeks (1–6)

Example links from the dataset are shown for Prime Owned, Prime Earned, and competitor.
